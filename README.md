# Description

Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard powered by SQL to analyze pizza sales data and track key business performance metrics.

## Key Highlights

Extracted and cleaned data using SQL queries to calculate KPIs: Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas per Order.

Built insightful Power BI visuals including:

üìÖ Daily & Monthly order trends

üçï Sales distribution by pizza category and size

‚≠ê Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas by Revenue, Orders, and Quantity

Delivered actionable insights into customer preferences, sales patterns, and underperforming products.

## SQL DataBase Setup & Data Preparation

I started by opening Microsoft SQL Server and creating a new database. Then, I imported the pizza sales datasets into the database. To gain insights into business performance, I analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs). I also extracted and cleaned the data using SQL queries, which have been documented in a separate file.

## Power BI Data Cleaning & Transformation

I connected Power BI to the SQL Server database and imported the pizza sales datasets. In Power Query, I performed data cleaning and transformation. For example, in the 'pizza size' column, I replaced letter values with corresponding words using the 'Replace Values' option. From the 'order date' column, I extracted the day name and created a conditional column that assigned numbers to days of the week (e.g., Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 3, etc.). These steps were done to improve the accuracy of visuals and reports.

## DAX Measures & Calculated Columns for KPI Analysis

Based on the KPI requirements, I created DAX measures and calculated columns. I extracted the day name and month name from the date field, and then used the LEFT function to display only the first three letters (e.g., 'Mon', 'Jan') for cleaner visuals.
